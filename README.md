The goal of the project is to compare two types of cells (WT and KO).

Image segmentation on the raw measured data was applied to extract the properties of nuclei and chromosomes. The raw data consists of 600 grayscale images, 300 for each cell type, which in turn correspond to 100 fields of view, as each frame is made up of 3 different color planes.

Segmentation was successfully applied, resulting in a set of pixels for each segmented object.

After segmenting the nuclei and the chromosomes, calculations of the properties of chromosomes (area, circularity, colocalization) were possible.
